# Biostat – Clinical Data Review & Exploratory Analysis (SAS)

This repository contains a focused SAS-based project designed to simulate common clinical and biostatistical data review workflows.  
The project demonstrates hands-on experience with clinical-style datasets, with emphasis on data quality assessment, exploratory analysis, and generation of review-ready outputs.

The scope reflects typical tasks performed in clinical data science and biostatistical support roles, where the primary goal is to ensure data integrity, interpretability, and scientific usability rather than advanced modeling.

---

## Project Scope

The project focuses on:

- Clinical data quality checks and consistency review  
- Exploratory analysis of biomarker-style variables  
- Subject-level listings and summary tables for clinical review  
- Transparent and interpretable analytical outputs  

All scripts are written using standard SAS procedures commonly employed in clinical and biomedical analysis environments.

## SAS Scripts Overview

### data_qc.sas – Data Quality and Review
This script performs initial inspection and quality control of clinical-style tabular data, including:
- Import of structured datasets  
- Inspection of variable structure and types  
- Missing value assessment  
- Basic descriptive statistics and range checks  

---

### exploratory_analysis.sas – Exploratory Analysis
This script supports data interpretation through exploratory summaries:
- Descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit  
- Simple trend exploration for biomarker variables  
- Identification of patterns relevant for clinical and scientific review  

---

### listings_tables.sas – Listings and Summary Outputs
This script generates outputs suitable for clinical data review:
- Subject-level listings of key variables  
- Summary tables for internal review and discussion  
- Export-ready outputs for downstream use  

---

## Intended Use

This project is intended as a demonstrative example to showcase familiarity with:
- Clinical and biostatistical data review workflows  
- SAS-based data handling and analysis  
- Translating raw clinical-style data into interpretable summaries  

It is not intended to represent a production pipeline or a regulatory submission.

## Tools and Environment

- SAS (Base SAS procedures)
- SAS Studio (cloud-based environments)

## Notes

The dataset used for this project is not included in the repository.  
The scripts are written to operate on generic clinical-style tabular data and can be adapted to different datasets and study contexts.

The emphasis of this project is on clarity, interpretability, and alignment with real-world clinical data review practices.
